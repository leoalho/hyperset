Welcome to play a game of Joukko, an online multiplayer pattern recognition game.<br>
The objective of the game is simple: to find all "collections" of three diamonds spread around the playing field.<br>
The playing field consist of 81 individually coloured diamonds, of which you can see 9 at any moment. Your player is marked as a circle in the middle of the playing field.
All diamonds have four quadrants, each having one of three different colours. 
You can move around on the field with WASD or arrow buttons, or with the arrow buttons displayed when playing with a mobile device. 
On the right of the playing field your coordinates are shown, note that the playing field is wrapped around
its y and x axes, meaning that coordinate 0 follows coordinate 8. 
Diamonds are chosen by clicking on them. You earn one point for each collection found. You lose one point if you chose three diamonds that do not form a collection.<br>
In addition to your coordinates, right of the playing field is also shown the total amount of collections to be found on the current field, as well as the top 5 players at the moment.<br>
Determing a collection:<br>
A collection is correct either if for each quadrant the colours in all of the three chosen diamonds are identical with each other or all colours are different with each other.<br>

For instance the image above, which is also seen on the starting screen shows three diamonds that form a collection: The upper left and upper right quadrants are 
all different from each other (green, orange, blue, and blue orange green), whereas the lower left and lower right quadrants are all identical. Note that not each view of 9 cards
contains a collection. In order to see the amount of collections on the current view, you can click the hint button. You have 3 hints at the beginning of the game. 
Finding a collection grants you an extra hint, as well as placing in the top 3 of a round.
A round ends when all collections have been found.
